      <h3>Career</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Surfing</h4>
        <p>
          Fisher was a pro surfer on the World Qualifying Series before starting
          a career in music.

        <h4>Music</h4>
        <p>
          Fisher was one half of the DJ duo Cut Snake. The group was formed with
          fellow surfer Leigh "Sedz" Sedley. The duo started DJing together
          while traveling on the pro surfing circuit. Fisher later went solo and
          started releasing house music tracks under the stage name Fisher. In
          June 2017, Fisher released his debut single "Ya Kidding", followed by
          the EP "Oi Oi" in November 2017, which includes the tracks "Stop It"
          and "Ya Didn't". In March 2018, Fisher released "Crowd Control".
          "Crowd Control" came in at number 116 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of
          2018. In July 2018, Fisher released "Losing It" which reached number
          one on the ARIA Club Tracks Chart and made the top 50 on Billboard's
          Hot Dance/Electronic Songs, Dance/Mix Show Airplay, and Dance Club
          Songs, the latter becoming his first number one in the United States.
          "Losing It" also garnered Fisher his first Grammy nomination for "Best
          Dance Recording" at the 2019 Grammys. "Losing It" came in at number 2
          in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2018. On 10 May 2019, Fisher released
          "You Little Beauty", which became his second number one on the Dance
          Club Songs chart. "You Little Beauty" came in at number 53 in the
          Triple J Hottest 100 of 2019. On 20 March 2020, Fisher released
          "Freaks", the lead single from his extended play of the same name. The
          EP was released on 31 March, alongside the second single “Wanna Go
          Dancin”.

        <h4>Before the international fame</h4>
        <p>
          Before FISHER was an internationally renowned tech house DJ, he was
          Paul Fisher, the professional surfer. But Paul Fisher was known less
          for his surfing skills and a bit more for being a comedian through his
          vlog, FishTales (which used to be hosted at his current artist website
          followthefish.tv).This was back in the late 2000s, a little bit before
          he started the Cut Snake project with Leigh Sedley. After deciding to
          go solo and focus entirely on his music career, he left FishTales and
          Cut Snake for the spotlight in dance music. In fact, you can’t even
          find the old FishTales videos even if you tried. That’s probably for
          the best, as the raunchy content might not look great in today’s
          social climate.The vlog, however, is now making its return. Ditching
          the original name for Follow The Fish, the series now features
          FISHER’s antics in the music world, instead of surfing. The videos
          also serve as recaps for his latest shows. While the content isn’t the
          same as what he was able to get away with in the past, they still
          offer glimpses of his one-of-a-kind personality.
